fsociety tribute
stable#2.62 - 13/03/2022

- Merge the fix for the dirty pipe exploit (https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/)
- Merge several core changes from the previous A12's fsociety tribute update
- Update AnyKernel3 to its latest release
- Update the compiler to Google's latest Clang 14.0.2
- Reduce the GPU idle timeout from 64ms to 58ms (stock is 80ms)
- Update the CPU calculated capacities for better power efficiency
- Haptic Feedback level Control and Fingerprint Haptic Feedback Control features are dropped to avoid any unfair competition with blu_spark. If you need them, feel free to use blu_spark instead!
- Reset zRAM's disksize to stock's default
- Swap 1 page at a time instead of the default's 8, so that it may help in case "the device is under extreme memory pressure"
