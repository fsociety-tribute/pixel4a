- Merge code fixes to Android's binder driver

- Replace srandom with LRNG as the latter is a preferable choice in terms of updates and overall performance (thanks to atndko, celtare21 and arter97)
- Disable MSM_JTAGV8 "to avoid potential power, performance and memory penalty" (source: qcom's Kconfig file - thanks to Freak07)
- fs: f2fs: Make iostat_enable read-only to reduce file system overhead (thanks to celtare21)
- Minimize alarmtimer wakeup time to reduce idle power consumption (thanks to xNombre)
- fsociety tribute tuning script's changes:
Set zRAM's compression algorithm back to lz4
Calculate zRAM's disksize using half of the total RAM's value
Reduce the overall execution delay's sleep time (thanks to engstk) to fix the post-boot's potential 3rd parties changes made to zRAM 
- Revert "msm: camera: Kill the vsync notification driver" to avoid any suspicious/speculated issues with apps that use the camera's augmented reality features
