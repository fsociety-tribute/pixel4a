stable#2.54 - 11/02/2022

- Clang 12 is used again for compiling the kernel until further notice/change
- Revert "defconfig: enable ld deadcode elimination" (by engstk)
- The kernel is upstreamed to 4.14.264 from linux-stable
- February 2022 security patches merged-in with fixes from A12L beta 3
- Merge the latest security and code fixes from CAF
- Update AnyKernel3 to its latest release
- Changes from Proton kernel (by kdrag0n):
arm64: dts: sdmmagpie: Power off DSI PHY during idle PC 
arm64: dts: sunfish: Tweak QG SOC to be more linear/monotonic (Proton kernel)
That fixes the stock kernel's unlinear battery level drop, especially between 100% and 90%. The device will need a few charge-discharge cycles to take it into consideration.
Save 72MB of RAM by removing the unused memory dump regions
- Fix the suspend kernel panic reported by krysztof on Telegram
- Fix memory leaks present in the stock kernel's camera driver (by sultanxda/kerneltoast)
- Power optimization changes:
qos: Don't allow userspace to impose restrictions on CPU idle levels (by sultanxda/kerneltoast)
kernel: time: reduce ntp wakeups 
Revert the mmap/mremap upstream code backports included in the previous update to prefer a more balanced usage
Revert some zRAM lz4 compression algorithm's code updates that had allegedly an impact on battery life
- fsociety tribute tuning script's changes:
Remove the tuning script's governor tunables. We use the kernel's stock values now because the governor has been updated a while ago.
